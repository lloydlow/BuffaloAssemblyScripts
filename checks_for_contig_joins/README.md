# Checks for contig joins
## Reodering scaffolds
The individual shell scripts to order scaffolds can be found inside folder 'scripts_for_reordering_scaffolds'. It basically made use of CombineFasta tool to order scaffolds so that the outcome is syntenic to cattle. If any error is made with these reordering, then one can quickly check from what has changed when compared to the result straight after HiRise scaffolding. However, for now, there is no better data to suggest whether such suspicious scaffold joins are errors or not. Note that the naming of scaffolds follow the results given after HiRise.
